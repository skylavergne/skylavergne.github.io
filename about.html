    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Arcanum Litterarum is a sanctuary for curious minds. We explore literature, philosophy, and art, uncovering the hidden layers of creativity and thought. 
      Our goal is to inspire readers and creators alike.
    </p>

    <h1>Our Manifesto</h1>

    <p>  
      “Between shadow and light, between word and thought, we seek the hidden truths of human imagination.”
      <br><br>
      At Arcanum Litterarum, literature, art, and philosophy are gateways. Each creation holds a doorway to understanding ourselves and the world. 
      We are wanderers of ideas, seekers of meaning in quiet corners of libraries and forgotten manuscripts. Curiosity guides us, reflection shapes us, and creativity sustains us.
      <br><br>
      Here, genres and disciplines intertwine; poetry whispers to philosophy, prose dances with art. Every creation mirrors our collective consciousness.
      <br><br>
      We invite the curious, the dreamers, the thinkers, and the rebels of imagination. Explore the hidden layers of knowledge, embracing both the light of discovery and the shadow of contemplation.
      <br><br>
      Every page is a threshold, every idea a spark, every mind a universe waiting to unfold. 
      <br><br>
      Join us. Read. Reflect. Create.
    </p>

    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      My name is <strong>Sky Cielo Lavergne</strong>, creator and curator of <em>Arcanum Litterarum</em>.
      <br><br>
      This project was born from a deep love for literature, philosophy, and art — and from the belief that
      words still matter in a world moving too fast to listen.
      <br><br>
      Arcanum Litterarum is my personal archive of thought, a space where curiosity is sacred and reflection is an act of resistance.
      Here, I gather fragments of meaning, voices from the past and present, and invite others to slow down, read deeply, and think freely.
      <br><br>
      Between books, silence and unanswered questions, this is where I write, read and wander.
